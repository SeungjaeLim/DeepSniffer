# DeepSniffer
DeepSniffer is a model extraction framework that predicts the model architecture of the victim models based on the architecture hints during their execution. Specifically, this project mainly provides the most important part: layer sequence prediction. The key concept of DeepSniffer is to transform the layer sequence to a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem.
